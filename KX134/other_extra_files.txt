imu acqusition layer  - > it says that when and how to get the imu data 
bus is like interface -> it knows how to get the data
task it does-> The IMU acquisition layer controls the sampling behavior and data flow between the driver and the rest of the system
1. initilaises the imu
2. decides when to read -> rules are -> 1. polling, 2. poll when data ready is true, interrupt fire, timer based freq
3. read data safely
4. push into buffer
5. mainain deterministic sampling
---------
coming to the fifo buffer internally present in kx134-1211 -> it can store 512 samples ->
1 sample  = 6 bytes(x,y,z)
so 512 samples  = 3KB

------------

in imu conversion -> lets first print the og data and then after validation , will use efficent methodd while tx to gnd
calibration -> 

reduce fifo size
classes add
fdir -> no infinite loops
plan a test case file -> that does check whether 

while using cpp
lets avoid -> dynamic memnory allocation, no stl, no virtual functions, no heap


i2c low and high pin pullling sda chweck in the bus file
